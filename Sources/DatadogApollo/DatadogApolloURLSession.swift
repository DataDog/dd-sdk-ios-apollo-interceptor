/// Custom URLSession wrapper for Apollo iOS v2 that enables Datadog network instrumentation.
///
/// Apollo iOS v2's default implementation uses `bytes(for:delegate:)` with `delegate: nil`, which
/// prevents URLSessionDataDelegate methods from being invoked. This wrapper uses `dataTask(with:)`
/// without a completion handler to ensure delegate methods fire, allowing Datadog's swizzling to
/// capture network data. It bridges delegate callbacks to async/await continuations and returns
/// data as an `AsyncChunkSequence` for Apollo v2 compatibility.
///
/// - Note: Must be used with `DatadogApolloDelegate`. Register the delegate via
///   `URLSessionInstrumentation.enable(with: .init(delegateClass: DatadogApolloDelegate.self))`
